        <h2>Design and Accessibility</h2>

        <p>The Design Role Group includes user research, user experience (UX), and presentation decisions. Some roles within this group define the user experience of a product, designing its behaviors and interactions with the end user and/or their assistive technologies. Some roles provide the general "look and feel" of the products and features, covering presentation, fonts and colors.</p>

        <h3>User Experience Research</h3>
        <p>UX Researchers conduct both exploratory and generative research with end users to gather their feedback. They test existing concepts and summarize user insights to inform accessible design decisions.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Conducting user research that includes participants with disabilities</li>
            <li>Testing accessibility with real users and assistive technologies</li>
            <li>Gathering feedback on accessibility barriers and solutions</li>
            <li>Informing design decisions based on inclusive research findings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User Experience Design</h3>
        <p>UX Designers create the overall user experience, from conceptualizing user journeys to defining interactions. They focus on information architecture, wireframes, and prototypes that work for all users.</p>

            <li>Creating prototypes that demonstrate accessible interactions</li>
            <li>Defining user journeys that work for users with disabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visual Design</h3>
        <p>Visual Designers focus on the look and feel of a product as an end user would experience it. This includes accessible interface elements, appropriate color contrast, and inclusive visual design principles.</p>

        <h4>Visual Design Responsibilities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring sufficient color contrast ratios</li>
            <li>Designing interfaces that don't rely solely on color</li>
            <li>Creating accessible iconography and visual elements</li>
            <li>Developing style guides with accessibility specifications</li>
            <li>Designing for various screen sizes and magnification levels</li>
        </ul>
