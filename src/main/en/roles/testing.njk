        <h2>Testing and Accessibility</h2>

        <p>QA Testers run automated test frameworks or manually test products to confirm correct operation based upon provided requirements. The main accessibility role of a QA Tester in the accessibility lifecycle is to understand the accessibility requirements that exist and to run tests to ensure the product or feature conforms to those requirements.</p>

        <h3>QA Testing Overview</h3>
        <p>Quality Assurance (QA) Testers typically don't contribute directly to the design and development phases of a product. They may have the opportunity to review and sign off on designs before they are implemented. The testing roles include both automated and manual testing approaches, and many QA professionals will do both.</p>

        <h3>Automated QA Testing</h3>
        <p>Quality Assurance automation frameworks run against products to test features and functionality. QA Testers performing automated tests are responsible for running tests within an automation framework that covers accessibility features and requirements.</p>

        <h4>Automated Testing Responsibilities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementing automated accessibility testing tools in CI/CD pipelines</li>
            <li>Running automated accessibility scans using tools like axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse</li>
            <li>Setting up accessibility testing frameworks and libraries</li>
            <li>Creating automated tests for keyboard navigation and focus management</li>
            <li>Integrating accessibility checks into existing test suites</li>
            <li>Monitoring accessibility regression through automated testing</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Automated tools typically uncover about 30-35% of potential accessibility issues. The remaining 65-70% require manual testing.</p>

        <h3>Manual QA Testing</h3>
        <p>Manual QA Testing handles testing that cannot be covered through automated tools. These testers typically have deeper knowledge about accessibility requirements and experience operating assistive technologies.</p>

        <h4>Manual Testing Responsibilities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Testing with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack)</li>
            <li>Validating keyboard-only navigation and interaction</li>
            <li>Testing color contrast and visual accessibility</li>
            <li>Verifying proper heading structure and semantic markup</li>
            <li>Testing form accessibility and error handling</li>
            <li>Validating ARIA implementation and assistive technology compatibility</li>
            <li>Testing across different devices and assistive technology combinations</li>
            <li>Conducting usability testing with users who have disabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Testing Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Requirements Review:</strong> Understanding accessibility requirements and acceptance criteria</li>
            <li><strong>Test Planning:</strong> Creating comprehensive test plans that include accessibility scenarios</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Testing:</strong> Running automated accessibility scans and tests</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Testing:</strong> Conducting detailed manual accessibility testing</li>
            <li><strong>Assistive Technology Testing:</strong> Testing with actual assistive technologies</li>
            <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> Including users with disabilities in testing processes</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Documenting findings with clear remediation guidance</li>
            <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Retesting after fixes are implemented</li>
        </ol>
