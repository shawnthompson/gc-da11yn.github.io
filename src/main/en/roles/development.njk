        <h2>Development and Accessibility</h2>

        <p>The Development Role Group oversees the creation, coding and delivery of the product based upon the requirements provided. Responsible for all user-facing and supporting systems, along with all related infrastructure selection, setup and deployment with accessibility considerations integrated throughout.</p>

        <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
        <p>Front-end development builds the parts of a product that will be interacted with by the user - specifically, the user interface. This includes implementing accessible HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that works with assistive technologies.</p>

        <h4>Front-End Accessibility Responsibilities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing semantic HTML with proper structure and landmarks</li>
            <li>Implementing ARIA labels and properties correctly</li>

            <li>Testing with screen readers and other assistive technologies</li>
            <li>Optimizing performance for users with slower connections or devices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
        <p>Back-end developers have a smaller, more indirect involvement with accessibility work, but still play a critical role in delivering accessible products. The underlying product architecture can inform accessibility solutions.</p>

        <h4>Back-End Accessibility Responsibilities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Designing APIs that support accessible front-end implementations</li>
            <li>Ensuring database structure supports accessibility metadata</li>
            <li>Implementing server-side validation that works with assistive technologies</li>
            <li>Supporting content management systems with accessibility features</li>
            <li>Optimizing performance to reduce barriers for users with slower connections</li>
            <li>Implementing security measures that don't interfere with accessibility</li>
        </ul>
