        <h2>Administration and Accessibility</h2>

        <p>The Administration Role Group covers managing the product and project, as well as other organizational functions that often have a larger mandate than any individual project. Most administrative roles have very little direct involvement with the design, implementation, or testing of accessibility principles, but are instrumental in ensuring that team members actively making content accessible can be successful.</p>

        <h3>Product Ownership</h3>
        <p>Product owners own individual products and define their features. They are key to defining the importance of accessibility on a project and ensuring that products meet both business and user needs, including accessibility requirements.</p>
